our AWS zone Oregan, which is cheepest of all
mongo cluster run on m5 large
    we have reserved instances t3 8x large
study EKS autoscaling
Mongo db cluster   
    we have 1xPrimary, 2xRead, 1Bi 
        we have 4 clusters like above
        which makes a total of 16 nodes
ssh mongo instance  
    type mongod
        if system gives an error that means it is unable to understand the language, so we change language 
            LC-ALL=C
            now type mongod, it will run
to check the status of nodes run command
    rs.status
    it will show all the nodes running with their status.
    do check that timestamp is the same, as timestamp is the number of data in db. so there should be not more than 10, in the number of difference in each node.
command run
    show dbs
    #if you see all salves in the cluster , run command rs.slaveOk() , it will automatically make one primary and other slave.
we only give /data and /journal directories to mongo 
to check mongo config
